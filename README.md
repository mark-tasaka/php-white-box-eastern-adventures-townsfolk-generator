# php-white-box-eastern-adventures-townsfolk-generator
The ‘White Box: Eastern Adventures’ Non-Player Character (NPC) Townsfolk Generator is designed with PHP to randomly generate a list of 12 Townsfolk.  A series of drop-down menus appear on the Launch Page, providing the user with options for customizing the Townsfolk generated.  POST methods are used to collect the data from the drop-down menus, where the data is sent to townsfolk.php.  Wherever possible, external PHP files have been created to store related functions; thus, aiming to create a program with high cohesion and low coupling, an important principle of object-orientated design.
